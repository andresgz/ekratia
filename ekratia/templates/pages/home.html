                    <p class="text-faded"> Since its inception over 2,000 years ago, democracy has had many shapes and forms. Initially, democracy was direct. Nowadays all democratic countries use representative democracy. Representative democracy, as we know it, was designed between the fifteen and eighteen century with the objective of allowing large numbers of people over large extensions of land to be part of a single government. It made sense then when it was impractical for individuals to always vote directly, either because of the number of voters involved or because they lived far away from the political center of their governments. As such, today's democratic elections are limited, by the most part, to the selection of the officials that will represent our vote for years to come. Electing politicians that sit in power for multiple years has many drawbacks, including corruption, unfulfilled promises, personal agendas, and corporate lobbying. This, in turn, has lead to the current democratic apathy that a large portion of the population has. Many have lost faith in their leaders.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">In Ekratia we believe that today's connected world can have a better democracy: one that combines direct democracy with real-time representative democracy. Members of Ekratia will use the Internet to vote directly for new ideas, laws, and referendums. In case they are too busy to vote, members can delegate their vote to other members. Delegates can delegate their accumulated votes to other delegates (thus creating a voting sequence similar to how Google uses links to determine which pages are the most relevant). Members can change their delegates on real time. Members can also vote directly for laws and referendums, thus overriding their existing delegations for specific decisions. All of this with full transparency, including open data and open-source software.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">We also believe that thoughtful, open conversation is key for a successful democracy. That's why Ekratia has a section dedicated to political discourse. There, people are able to upvote their favorite topics and comments and downvote the ones they don't like. The most popular comments will rise to the top. This methodology, successfully implemented online by forums such as Hacker News and Reddit, enables civilized debate online.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-faded">Our plan is simple, yet ambitious:</p>

                    <ol class="text-faded">
                        <li>Make Ekratia the new online local forum where government and political conversations happen in thousands of communities around the world.</li>
                        <li>Allow leaders to surface in each community.</li>
                        <li>Provide them and their followers an online platform to take decisions and build a better government.</li>
                    </ol>


                    <p class="text-faded">And you can help.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">A group of six software engineers volunteered during the previous six months to build the technology platform that now powers Ekratia. The platform is ready for alpha testing. We are now looking for community managers that want to volunteer to build a better government. Interested? Contact us via Twitter @ekratia.
